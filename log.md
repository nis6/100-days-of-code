# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: January 8, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: A frontend mentor challenge(70%). Idea was to get the basics clear and do more advance stuff with fundamentals.

**Thoughts:** Spent whole day organising and decluttering, gathered resources and also set up todoist, so basically not very productive coding day
- a little bit procrastination about project, reason - maybe because the idea wasn't clear which way to go, gonna fix that, adding subtasks to my todoist.
- also this challenge I took focused on ReactJS and stuff, but Ig need to make a dedicated task line for practicing more tests and DSA.
