### Day 3: January 8, 2022 
  
**Today's Progress**: A frontend mentor challenge(70%). Idea was to get the basics clear and do more advance stuff with fundamentals.

**Thoughts:** Spent whole day organising and decluttering, gathered resources and also set up todoist, so basically not very productive coding day
- a little bit procrastination about project, reason - maybe because the idea wasn't clear which way to go, gonna fix that, adding subtasks to my todoist.
- also this challenge I took focused on ReactJS and stuff, but Ig need to make a dedicated task line for practicing more tests and DSA.

**What I learned:**  

**Link to work:** [A form](https://github.com/nis6/Mini-Projects/tree/master/Form/intro-component-with-signup-form-master/intro-component-with-signup-form-master)

### Day 2: January 7, 2022 

**Today's Progress**:  
-Done with the home page, (also had to fix up the designs a littleFace with raised eyebrow)

**Thoughts:** That font thing made me read up lit. evthg from CSS to Network proxies -turns out to be a stupid " ' " , I need to be patient with this, and **take breaks** and should solve these bug problems over time 

**What I learned:** 
- Didn't know StyleComponents don't work with camelCaseFace,
- **take breaks**  
- solve bugs over time go back 2-3 times rather than banging my head for hours in one go
